# MediSinGAN

 In this work, we study the utility of SinGAN‚Äîan unconditional generative model trained on a single image‚Äîfor synthetic data generationacross different imaging tasks, namely, multi-modal MRI (Magnetic ResonanceImaging) data generation, brain tumour data generation, and histopathology imagesegmentation.  These applications, built on SinGAN, could become a significantremedy to the data-deprived medical imaging tasks

## Random samples from a *single* image
With SinGAN, you can train a generative model from a single natural image, and then generate random samples from the given image, for example:

## SinGAN's applications
SinGAN can be also used for a line of image manipulation tasks, for example:
 ![](imgs/manipulation.PNG)
This is done by injecting an image to the already trained model. See section 4 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf) for more details.
